# Authentication Flow

Initially we had different auth routes for admin and user `admin/login` and `user/login`

The initiall code was writtern that that manner, however after a change request we have to merge those two functionalities. That's why this module is a little bit messy. 
More detailed explanation is done in the code itself. 

## Improvements

There is a lot of room for refactoring. If you want you can clean the code, just make sure you don't break anything.
